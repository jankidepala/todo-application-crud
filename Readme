This is a simple app that lets you add items to a Todo list and edit their titles.

--------

**** Before you start please edit the TodoAPI.js file and change the userID constant to your email address. ****

To run the application on the HackerRank IDE:

1. From the menu select "Run/Install"
2. When step 1 is complete select "Run/Run"
3. You should now be able to open the app by clicking the preview button on the top right corner of the IDE.

Or if you are building it on your own computer:

- Run `npm install` in the project directory
- Run `npm run start` to build the app and start a server.
- You can access the app at http://127.0.0.1:8000

If all went well you should see a page with an "Add Todo" button. You should be able to reload the app and any changes you make should be persistent.

API
---

The application talks to a server using a simple REST API.

The JSON representation of the Todo items is

{
  id: string,
  title: string
}

The id is immutable and is generated by the server when the item is created.
This is a very simple React application that allows you to manage a list of "To Do" items. It currently only lets you add new items and edit them, and your task is to make the following improvements:

 

- Items take some time to be created and updated. Show some indication in the UI when a request is pending. Don't worry about making this look pretty, a simple text message will suffice.

- Add validation for titles. Users shouldn't be able to set a title that doesn't include any alphanumeric characters.

- Errors are silently ignored. Add error handling when editing titles.

  To test this, try setting a title to "ERROR" and the server will reject it.

- Implement item deletion

 
GET /todos
Returns an array of Todo items

POST /todos/new
Creates a new Todo with the specified title. A unique id is generated by the server.
You'll notice that creation takes about 2 seconds.

POST /todos/:todo

Parameters:
  :todo - The id of the item to update

  :todo - The id of the item to delete
